### About

I am David Zhang, graduated from Southeast University and later Queensland University of Technology.
Currently, I work as an engineer for Baidu Inc.
I mostly use and are familiar with PHP, awk, shell, nginx and C/C++.

This is my personal blog, built with open source power like Github Pages, Markdown and PHP.
The theme of the pages is inspired by [ArchLinux.org](http://www.archlinux.org).
It is mostly about computer stuffs, especially on programming tips and sharing of fantastic tools.

I enjoy simplicity and minimalism.
Exploring fantastic softwares and apps is my favorite hobby.
And I make use of them, including Chrome, vim, GitHub, SublimeText, Foobar 2000, Wunderlist, Evernote, Pocket and Instagram.
In addition, I enjoy building web pages, customized configurations, software extensions and utility scripts.
In non-programming spare time, I like reading books with Kindle and [girls](http://crispgm.github.io/image/gwp1.jpg) [wearing](http://crispgm.github.io/image/gwp2.jpg) [pantyhose](http://crispgm.github.io/image/gwp3.jpg).
