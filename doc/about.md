I am David Zhang. I enjoy simplicity and minimalism. 

I use PHP, nginx, awk and shell in working. In private time, I also use C/C++, Python and building web pages and sometimes chrome extension. 
Exploring new apps, tools and features of is my favorite hobby. 

Apart from computer and programming stuffs, I like reading Kindle books and listening to classical music and pop music by AKB48, Rameses B, and Owl City. 
Playing soccer is my favorite sport and I am a big rugby union fan.
