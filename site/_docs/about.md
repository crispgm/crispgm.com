<div class="page-title">About</div>

Hello, I am David Zhang ([resume](https://crispgm.com/resume/){:target="_blank"}), a.k.a crisp or crispgm on the internet. I am a software engineer of fullstack web development. I make web products, and contribute to open source community. I write blog posts here, and post photos on Instagram.

I greatly appreciate minimalism and simplicity. I enjoy photography, reading, and coffee. And I go to the theater cheering for my idols with **glo-sticks** every weekends.
