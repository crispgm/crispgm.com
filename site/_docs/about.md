<div class="page-title">About</div>

Hello, I am David Zhang ([resume](https://crispgm.com/resume/){:target="_blank"}), a.k.a crisp or crispgm on the internet. I am a software engineer of fullstack web development. I make web products, and contribute to [open source community](/project.html). I write [blog posts](/blog.html) here, and post photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/crispgm){:target="_blank"}.

I greatly appreciate minimalism and simplicity. I enjoy photography, reading, coffee, and Japanese idol groups.
