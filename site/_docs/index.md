Hi, I am David Zhang, a.k.a __Crisp__ or __Crispgm__ on the internet. I work as a software engineer of web development, mainly focus on the LAMP stacks. And I am also a fullstack engineer in professional level and have sense of basic UI designs. Here is a [unofficial résumé](https://crispgm.com/resume/){:target="_blank"} for those interested.

Check out my latest blog post, "[{{ site.posts.first.title }}]({{ site.posts.first.url }})". [Subcribe blog updates](feed.xml){:target="_blank"}.

In leisure times, photography and coffee are things I greatly appreciate. I am interested in improving productivity with great tools chain and systematic methodology. And I go to the theater cheering for my idols with _glo-sticks_ every week.
