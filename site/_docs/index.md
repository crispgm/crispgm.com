Hi, I am David Zhang, a.k.a __Crisp__ or __Crispgm__ on the internet. I work as a software engineer of web development, mainly focus on the LAMP stacks. And I am also a fullstack engineer in professional level and have sense of basic UI designs. Here is an [unofficial rÃ©sumÃ©](https://crispgm.com/resume/){:target="_blank"} for those interested.

In leisure times, photography, reading and coffee are things I greatly appreciate. I am also interested in improving productivity with great tools chain and systematic methodology. And I go to the theater cheering for my idols with _glo-sticks_ every weekends.

I advocate:

* [Free and Open Internet](https://www.google.com/intl/en/takeaction/)
* [Fresh Air in China](/page/environment-pollution-in-a-photographer-view.html)
* [Against Piracy Software](/page/piracy-software-or-app.html)
* Against Cyberbullying
