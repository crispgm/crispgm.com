Coffee is one of [my favorite things](/things.html) and an important source of daily energy, which help me keep focus on work and be productive. I usually drink two cups of coffee provided by the company I serve every work day. And at the weekends, we need awesome coffee shops in Beijing city.

The data is powered by a open source project that I have contribute to all the time. It is called [awesome-cn-cafe](https://github.com/ElaWorkshop/awesome-cn-cafe), which is a curated list of awesome caf√© places in China. Currently, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are included.

Happy coffeeing!
