[Alfred Nord](https://github.com/crispgm/alfred-nord) is an unofficial port of [Nord theme](http://nordtheme.com/) for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) 3 & 4.

I have been a big fan of Nord theme for years and I have used official Nord themes for everything. e.g., iTerm2, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, neovim, tmux, and so on.

Alfred Nord theme is not provided officially, so I made this unofficial port, which follows Nord colors and palettes

Compared to other ports, I chose a smaller icon sizes to make it more neat.

### Install

- <https://www.alfredapp.com/extras/theme/5Y8E7URIWQ/>
- or manually download [`Nord.alfredappearance`](https://github.com/crispgm/alfred-nord/raw/master/Nord.alfredappearance).

_You need the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) for custom themes._

Finally, thanks Alfred and [Arctic Ice Studio](https://github.com/arcticicestudio) (designer of Nord) for making such good tool and color scheme. And hope you enjoy Alfred Nord.
