## Libraries

### [Terminal Table](https://github.com/tj/terminal-table)

_Terminal Table is a fast and simple, yet feature rich ASCII table generator written in Ruby._

Simple but useful gem for Ruby. `terminal-table` is really powerful and easy-to-use to build and display tables in console based GUI.

This is the official example of `terminal-table`:

```
rows = []
rows << ['One', 1]
rows << ['Two', 2]
rows << ['Three', 3]
table = Terminal::Table.new :rows => rows

# > puts table
#
# +-------+---+
# | One   | 1 |
# | Two   | 2 |
# | Three | 3 |
# +-------+---+
```

## macOS Specifics

### [MAS](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)

_Mac App Store command line interface._

It is designed for scripting and automation. However, I really like and need this awesome tool to update with terminal instead of the AppStore GUI, which fails frequently in China mainland.
