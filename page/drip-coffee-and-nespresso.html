          <p><em>HINT: This is a recommendation post on home coffee making based on my real experience.</em></p>

<p>I am a big coffee lover and addict. Coffee keeps me energetic with just enough sleep. Without coffee, I have to take a nap or sleep much more.</p>

<p>I buy coffee on work and go to coffee shop on weekends. It actually took considerable money. Thus, I brew coffee by myself.</p>

<h3 id="starter-kit">Starter Kit</h3>

<p>My very first kit is Penguin Drip Starter Kit, which includes basic setups for drip  coffee making. And I chose an indie coffee bean shop from Taobao — the Fisher Coffee.</p>

<p>Penguin Drip Starter Kit includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kalita Dripper</li>
  <li>Kalita Wave Filter Paper</li>
  <li>Bonavita Gooseneck Kettle</li>
  <li>WPM Coffee Bean Grinder</li>
  <li>Basic electronic weighter</li>
  <li>Basic glass server</li>
</ul>

<p>And later, a Kalita Glass Server because I broke the kit one.</p>

<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/penguin-starter-kit.jpg" alt="" />
<em>P.S. Blue Bottle Coffee is not included.</em></p>

<p>The price (¥1284/$188) is reasonable. It’s great for a new comer to understand how drip coffee works and dive into drip coffee with joy.</p>

<h3 id="the-problems">The Problems</h3>

<p>Drip coffee is actually <em>convenient</em>. But it’s not instant for a work morning. There was just not enough time to make one cup of coffee for myself, since I usually get up late.</p>

<p>Therefore, I made drip coffee only at the weekends. That sounds fine, however, it means a bag of beans would be kept for more than one month and it was not a good way to keep the beans fresh. At the beginning, it really smells and tastes good, especially during grind. In contrary, it becomes much bitter and more astringent. Big difference!</p>

<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/hario-canister.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I bought a <a href="https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productdetail.php?product=MCN-200B">Hario Coffee Canister</a> to store the beans, hoped to isolate air and reduce oxidation rate. But my experience proved that it made little contribution to the freshness unless I could consume the beans quickly.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that freshly brewed coffee works only if you brew frequently.</p>

<h3 id="drip-coffee-bag">Drip Coffee Bag</h3>

<p>Drip Coffee Bag provides a similar experience as typical drip coffee, and even faster and more convenient. More importantly, the oxidation rate is just low enough to keep on a good flavour level. Though it tastes worse than real fresh brewed coffee, its average taste is good enough for me as an occasional brewer.</p>

<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/fisher-coffee.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another advantage of coffee bag is that we may buy a pack with various kinds of beans, which means we can easily taste lots of beans.</p>

<p>With Drip Coffee Bag, I omitted the grinder step but it remained to be a weekend pleasure.</p>

<h3 id="nespresso">Nespresso</h3>

<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/sydney-opera-house.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I was staying at Sydney, the hotel provided Delonghi Nespresso coffee maker (however, I don’t know the exact model). I used it several times a day to get caffeinated. That’s great experience for me, both the city and the coffee.</p>

<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/nespresso-clips.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The machine I bought is Nespresso Clips, which is quite similar to Nespresso Pixie C60.</p>

<p>It basically need one minute to fill the water tank (if in need) and one more minute to brew and add some sugar. This enables me to get a cup of coffee every morning. In addition, it’s even easier to taste different flavours.</p>

<p>And there are major differences between Nespresso and drip coffee. Nespresso brews Espresso coffee or its derivatives. The tastes can be quite different, which is the reason why I will keep the drip coffee kit and have a drink when I want.</p>

<p>Enjoy the coffee life!</p>
